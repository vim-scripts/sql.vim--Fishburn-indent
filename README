This indent file was created for Sybase SQL Anywhere using the Watcom SQL syntax.
It has also been tested against Oracle packages.

This will not work for Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server which use Transact-SQL syntax.

In preparation for Vim 7, this file has been renamed to sqlanywhere.vim, but will continue to work with Vim 6.  Simply rename it to sql.vim to keep the default behaviour.

Supports a wide variety of syntax including standard the standards: IF, LOOP, CASE.
But it will also support less used syntax like the EXCEPTION statement.
